# My swaywm dotfiles

This is my swaywm configurations and dotfiles, with install scripts for convenience.

It's meant to be installed on an Arch based distro. *(Not Manjaro because Manjaro sucks and break AUR packages all the time)*. I used it on an EndeavourOS with no DEs installed, but you can probably run it on Vanilla Arch.

I haven't tested the install scripts that many times, so you should maybe double check it and see if it's good.Or maybe do everything manually just to be sure.

### Prerequisites: have `yay` installed.

### Steps:
- Run `installpackages.sh` to install all the packages.
- Run `installer.sh` to install dotfiles and configs.

### Notes
This folder comes with a backup script `backup.sh` so you can customize your dotfiles and back them up to your own github. 

I'm not liable if you break your system. Run them at your own risks. You should always check the contents of bash scripts before running them.
